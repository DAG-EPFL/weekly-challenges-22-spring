    "# Weekly Challenge 4\n",
    "##  Description\n",
    "Welcome to the 4th challenge! This week, we will see how to apply our algorithm knowledge to find ways to make money in the financial markets. *Not investment advice etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are 13 weeks late on your algorithms course. You decide to sift through the videos at 10x speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "After 1 hour of intense speedrunning, you suddenly hear the professor joking about \"this is how you could theoretically make money\", so you rewind the video and hear the professor say: _\"The Bellman-Ford algorithm can be used by currency speculators to find arbitrages in foreign exchange (FOREX) markets.\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "After a few Google searches, you gather the following definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **[Bellman-Ford algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm)** is used to find the shortest path from a source vertice to every other vertice.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An **[arbitrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage)** is the practice of simultaneously buying and selling the same asset in different markets to profit from tiny differences in the asset's listed prices. \n",
    "    * Here's an example based on the currency graph below:\n",
    "        * 1 U.S. dollar bought 0.82 Euro, 1 Euro bought 129.7 Japanese Yen, 1 Japanese Yen bought 0.12 Turkish Lira, and 1 Turkish Lira bought 0.08 U.S. dollars. \n",
    "        * Following this graph, a trader can start with 1 U.S. dollar and buy U.S. dollars, thus turning 1 USD into:\n",
    "        $$0.82 \\times 129.7 \\times 0.12 \\times 0.08 = 1.02 \\;\\text{USD}$$\n",
    "            * The trader thus made a **2%** profit.\n",
    "            \n",
    "(If the image doesn't display, please open _currency_graph.png_ in the _challenge04_ folder.)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"currency_graph.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The task\n",
    "You find out that in order to find an arbitrage you must find a path between the given currencies whose **product** of exchange rates is greater than 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, find an infinite loop from the inconsistencies in <span style='color:red'>_arbitrage_graph_</span> (the input array below) to make, on paper, infinite money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you can also try to optimize your result by finding the **maximal** product of exchange rates in the graph (i.e., the best arbitrage).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** \n",
    "* The Bellman-Ford algorithm is a *shortest path algorithm*. Such algorithms aim at **minimizing** the **sum** of the weights between two vertices in a graph."
