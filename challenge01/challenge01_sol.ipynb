    "Welcome to the 1st challenge! This semester, 6 challenges will be proposed, with increasing difficulty:\n",
    "* 2 \"easy\" challenges (challenges 1-2)\n",
    "* 2 \"medium\" challenges (challenges 3-4)\n",
    "* 2 \"hard\" challenges (challenges 5-6)\n",

    "\n",
    "A student in microengineering, Jane Doe has barely started the semester. Yet, she is already preparing her course selection for the next semester (in **Autumn** (Code: **A**)).\n",
    "\n",
    "To become an accomplished and versatile engineer, she decides to look into computer science (code : **CS**), mechanics (code: **ME**) and biology (codes: **BIO** and **BIOENG**) classes, and considers dedicating between **6** and **12** credits (in total) to these fields. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge:** find out the number of possible course selections Jane can choose from the above-mentioned fields (CS/ME/BIO/BIOENG) that total between 6 and 12 credits (including 6 and 12).\n",
    "* For this challenge, you will work on an excerpt from the Microengineering coursebook, available as a CSV file: _MT.plan2021-2022.csv_\n",
    "    * (You can use [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to read the file)"
